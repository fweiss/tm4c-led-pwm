# include directory
This has the "HAL" divided into several files.
Each file is a C++ header file which is included in the app
and also in these header files.

Since this code is all C++ template classes, there
are no "cc" files as is the normal case.
The template classes have "static constexpr" members.
In effect, the compiler does not produce code from these directly.
You can think of the compiler "saving" the class declarations
and only outputing code when a runtime execution is needed.

Not that in C++, using "constexpr" is a powerful way to
have rather elaborate computations evaluated at compile
time instead of runt time.
